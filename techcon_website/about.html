        <h2>The Origins and Evolution of TechCon</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2001, TechCon began as a modest gathering of tech
          enthusiasts and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. Initially, it was a
          one-day event aimed at fostering innovation in the rapidly changing
          tech landscape.
